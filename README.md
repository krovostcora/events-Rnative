# Events App (React Native)

This is the frontend part of the **Events App**, which I'm developing during my internship.  
The app allows users to create, manage, and register for different types of events, including races.

## Features

- Event creation with optional race-specific fields  
- Date-based event search  
- Participant registration and management  
- Support for both iOS (Expo Go) and web (via Expo)  
- Basic form validation and PDF previews (in FreeForm)  
- Clean minimalist UI inspired by early 2000s desktop apps

## Backend

This repository includes only the frontend.  
The backend (Node.js + Express) is available here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [events-server](https://github.com/krovostcora/events_server)

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krovostcora/events-Rnative
cd events-Rnative
npm install
npx expo start
```
